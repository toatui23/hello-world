# fall2019-sprint2-starter-code
This is a feature complete version of Sprint 1 code made by @nelsonni and others.

"Feature complete" - It has all the functionalities implemented required for demonstrating a proof of concept based on the requirements.

You can use either this code or your own version or a combination of both to start with Sprint 2. In either cases, make sure you copy the right files to the right directory in your existing team repository.

Note: Do not copy this code and claim it as your own for the Sprint 1 demo. You will get a 0.
